User Stories:

Coorperate.
    We want to be able to collect data on what the users prefer and what they don't.
    We want to be able to easily add new items to our test group, and remove underperformers.
    We do not want to bias the results, by letting users see the results before the survey is complete.

Developer.
    I want a check to make sure the user clicked on something valid.
    Mostly... I just want to make sure the customer and the user both get what they want in the project :-/.
    

User.
    I want a simple and intuitive layout.
    I don't want to accidentally 'select' an image with an errant click.
    

I reserve the right to update user stories periodically as I think of more and better ones.   For now though, this is what I've got.
